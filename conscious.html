           Conscious is an app designed to reduce food waste by generating personalized recipes based on supply in fridge
         <p>
          My group and I created a prototype of an app called "Conscious" that addresses food waste management concerns. <p>It addresses this by...
<ul>
    <li>Maintaining a list of perishable items within your fridge and relying information about their expiry </li>

    <li>Generating personalized recipes based off user-inputed inventory/ingredients, prioritized by expiry date</li>

    <li>Updating the grocery list based off current inventory and recipes</li>
 </ul>

        phase one: discovery
        <div class="caption">Initially, we went into this project with the intention to tackle the gap in technology and services that address food waste literacy and management solutions. 
<p></p>To investigate our claims... <ul>
            
            <li> We interviewed eight UofT students</li>
            <li> We surveyed 77 students. We exported the survey data and used it aid in determining a need.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
        
    </div> 
    
    <div class="project">
    phase two: interpretation
        <div class="caption">In this phase, we summarized the data received in the Discovery stage, and using an affinity diagram, we sorted them into six common themes: awareness, emotions, cooking, wasting money, waste management, and food purchasing.
<p></p>
​

With this, we identified key themes and pain-points about how people handle food waste: 
            <ul>
            <li>lack of grocery planning </li>
                <li>lack of meal planning</li> <li> and lack of education and awareness.</li>
                
                </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="project">phase 3: ideation
    <div class="caption">In this stage, we first identified the needs of our targeted users that we plan to address.
<p></p>
These needs included...
<ul>
 <li>A way to manage leftovers</li>

<li>A way to understand eating/disposal behaviors</li>

<li>Purchasing the right amount of ingredients</li>

<li>Education on food-expiry dates
</li>
        </ul>
​

With these needs in mind, we then  generated 20 ideas as potential solutions- we wrote down whatever ideas we could think of, no matter how absurd.

<p></p>

We then determined which of these ideas had the the highest impact and feasibility. Those that did were centered around education when it comes to food waste management and portioning/planning meals. </div>

    phase four: experimention
    <div class="caption">
     In this phase, we created a working prototype of our idea using Adobe XD. We started off with a lo-fi prototype, demonstrated through a series of sketches, and received user feedback. With the criticism and praise in mind, we created our mid-fi prototype.

    lessons learned
        <div class="caption">We learned that people had already established mental concepts of how features should look or feel and they would be confused if something was designed differently.  </div>
