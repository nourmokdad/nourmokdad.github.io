      Hello! I'm Nour, Toronto based user experience/interface designer with a passion for designing beautiful, working things.

<p>

I started off at the University of Toronto pursuing a computer science degree, until I realized my passion for design. UX/UI was the perfect mix for me, as it merged both the implementation skills that I grew to love, with the actual design of the interfaces. I am now in my final year studying what I love- the intersection of computer science, social sciences and humanities. Equipped with software development and design skills, I am passionate and looking forward to pursue both a creative and analytical career.
