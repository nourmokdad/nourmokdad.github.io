           As defined by <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/">darkpatterns.org</a>, Dark Patterns are tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to.

            I decided to explore the deceit and manipulation caused by dark patterns in retail environments. So, I prototyped an augmented reality situation on <a href="wiarframe.com">wiarframe.com</a> that takes advantage of a child's wholesome heart. It does this by marketing plush toys as if they're in an animal-shelter  environment, and manipulates children into feeling like they must save them. When a child approaches a plush, using proxemic interactions and an augmented reality, the plush will also approach them. This will manipulate the child into thinking that the plush "chose them", similar to being in an animal shelter.

        It's important to recognize deceitful patterns, its existence in product design, and its usage in manipulating consumers to purchase things they never intented to. As UX designers, we must ensure that users have positive experiences and are not being manipulated through implicit interactions. So, once we put a name to these dark patterns, we can avoid them in our designs.
        
        <p> To avoid dark patterns in our design, we must acknowledge their existence.</p>
